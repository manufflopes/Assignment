                Dev under construction... I have a diverse background in
                business and technology, with strong skills in analysis,
                strategic planning and project management. I made the career
                transition from business to software development in 2022. I
                looked for several courses, but the training still needed to be
                completed.

                In 2023, I moved to Canada to attend college and improve my
                proficiency in the English language. In this term, I am focused
                on the C++ programming language, but I will have C#, NodeJS,
                REACT, game development and cloud computing for the following
                few periods. I'm excited to leverage my unique experiences into
                a software development career.
